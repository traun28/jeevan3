Description
This project is a static HTML page designed to simulate a basic online shop. It features a clean, modern interface with a responsive layout, making it suitable for viewing on various devices. The primary goal was to showcase fundamental web development concepts, including semantic HTML structure, styling with a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind CSS), and simple client-side interactivity using JavaScript.

Navigation Bar: A sticky header with a site logo and navigation links.

Hero Section: A prominent banner to welcome users and highlight the shop's purpose.

Featured Products Section: Displays a grid of product cards with images, titles, descriptions, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.

Shop by Category Section: Provides quick links to different product categories.

Newsletter Subscription: A call-to-action section for email sign-ups.

Footer: Contains copyright information and basic navigation links.

Simple Cart Functionality: Client-side JavaScript to increment a cart counter when "Add to Cart" is clicked.
